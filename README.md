# TraceIt 

A smart, AI-powered lost and found application for college campuses, built with the MERN stack and Google Gemini.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Semantic Search:** Utilizes Google Gemini's embedding models to find matches based on the *meaning* of an item's description, not just keywords.
- **Detailed Item Reporting:** Users can report found items or request lost items with a detailed, multi-level classification system.
- **Photo & Video Uploads:** Users can upload media to provide a clearer description of an item.
- **Secure User Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for secure user registration and login.
- **Item Claim & Retrieval System:** A full workflow for users to claim items, provide proof of ownership, and for reporters to approve or reject claims.
- **Gamified Rewards System:** Reporters earn "Service Points" for every successfully returned item, with rewards for reaching milestones.
- **Bilingual Support:** Fully internationalized with seamless switching between **English** and **Hindi**.
- **Light & Dark Mode:** A modern, themeable interface for user comfort.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/traceit-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/traceit-app.git)
    cd traceit-app
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    - Navigate to the server directory:
      ```bash
      cd server
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
      ```env
      MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
      JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY
      GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
      ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    - Navigate to the client directory from the root folder:
      ```bash
      cd client
      ```
    - Install dependencies:
