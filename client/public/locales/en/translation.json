      {
        "q": "How does the AI matching work?",
        "a": "Our system converts your item details (title, description, location, category, photo) into special numeric codes called embeddings. It compares them across all items in the database to find the most semantically similar matches, not just keyword matches. English and Hindi descriptions are supported equally."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my personal information safe?",
        "a": "Yes. Only your name, department, and item details are shared during claims. Contact details are never exposed publicly. Chat and embeddings run securely, and all sensitive data is stored with protection."
      },
      {
        "q": "What happens after I claim an item?",
        "a": "When you claim a matched item, the reporter is notified. If they approve, a secure chat opens where you can verify ownership (for example, through unique marks). After successful handover, the reporter marks the item as resolved and you confirm retrieval. The item then disappears from the Matches section."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I earn service points?",
        "a": "When a reporter successfully returns a found item and the claimer confirms retrieval, the reporter automatically earns +100 Service Points. These points represent your helpfulness in the campus community."
      },
      {
        "q": "What if I don’t see any matches?",
        "a": "Try adding a clearer title, more detailed description, or uploading a photo. You can also refresh Matches manually using the 'Search matches now' button. New reports are continuously processed by the AI."
      },
      {
        "q": "What if my chat request is rejected?",
        "a": "If your chat request is rejected, it means the reporter believes the item doesn’t match your description. You can still claim or chat for other similar items."
      },
      {
        "q": "Where should we meet for item handover?",
        "a": "For safety, always meet in public campus areas like the library front desk or admin office. Verify ownership politely before handing over the item."
